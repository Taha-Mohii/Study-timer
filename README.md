#  Flip Countdown Timer with Sound

An animated **flip-style countdown study-timer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring smooth flip animations and audio when the timer ends.

This project was built to practice:
- JavaScript timing logic
- Browser audio APIs
---

##  Features

-  Set hours and minutes
-  Start, pause, resume the timer
-  Reset functionality
-  Smooth flip-card animation for time display
-  Repeating audio  when time is up
-  Prevents time changes while timer is running

---

##  How It Works (Concept)

- The timer **counts internally using seconds**
- Hours, minutes, and seconds are **derived from total seconds**
- Flip animations are handled by **CSS**, triggered by JavaScript
- Audio is unlocked safely using a user interaction (browser requirement)

## note: for css some help from AI was used.
